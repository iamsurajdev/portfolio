          Hi,I'm Suraj. Nice to meet you{" "}

        <p>
          I'm from Kolkata, India. I start learning programming from the start
          of 2020. From my childhood, I have a huge interest in technology, and
          when I first introduced to code my interest find a way to expand.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a self taught programmer, I have to learn everything by myself no
          college no teacher no friends from coding background. I have only one
          hope that i can become a Programmer. So it's not easy but not
          impossible. I hope people in future time take self-taught as an option
          of learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than code, i love to create, learn, and teach people. Other than
          code I like Art, Human biology, Producing music, Indian Mysticism,
          computer hardware.
