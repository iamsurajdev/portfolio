          Hi,I'm Suraj. Nice to meet you{" "}

        <p>
          I'm from Kolkata, India. I start learning programming at the start of
          2020. From my childhood, I have had a huge interest in technology, and
          when I was first introduced to code my interest find a way to expand.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a self-taught programmer, I learned everything by myself no college
          no teacher no friends from a coding background. I had only one hope
          that I can become a Programmer one day. And today I am working as a
          Software Developer. So it's not easy but not impossible. I hope people
          in future time take self-taught as an option of learning.
